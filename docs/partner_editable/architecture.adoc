As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:
* AWS Marketplace for managing subscriptions and passing tokens with customer billing identifiers and product codes to AWS Marketplace Metering Service and Entitlement Service APIs. 
* Amazon CloudFront for providing the configurable URL for the SaaS product integration.
* CloudFront Lambda@Edge for intercepting, transforming, and passing customer tokens.
* Amazon S3 for storing the static HTML pages that accept and submit user input to the AWS Marketplace customer endpoints. 
* AWS Lambda for handling customer endpoints and validating AWS Marketplace customer tokens.
* Amazon DynamoDB for storing valid customer records in a DynamoDB table.
* Amazon API Gateway for generating the new endpoint base URL after the AWS CloudFormation stack is deployed. 

//[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
