As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following environment:

* AWS Marketplace for managing customer subscriptions and passing tokens with customer billing identifiers and product codes to AWS Marketplace Metering Service and Entitlement Service APIs. 
* AWS Lambda for intercepting, transforming, and passing customer tokens.
* Amazon CloudFront for providing the configurable registration page URL for the SaaS product integration.
* Amazon S3 for storing the static HTML pages that accept and submit registration input to the AWS Marketplace customer endpoints. 
* Amazon API Gateway for receiving tokens from form data on the registration page and generating the new endpoint base URL after the AWS CloudFormation stack is deployed.
* AWS Lambda for handling customer endpoints and validating AWS Marketplace customer tokens.
* Amazon DynamoDB for storing valid customer records in a DynamoDB table.
