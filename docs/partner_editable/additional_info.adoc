== Post-deployment steps

=== Set up your registration page

After your stack has launched successfully, set up your registration page and connect it with the API Gateway created by the stack. Your registration page will be hosted in the website S3 bucket that was created by the stack earlier. 

. https://awsmp-usageinstructions.s3.amazonaws.com/SaaSQuickStartRegistrationPage.zip[Download^] the website files to your local computer. 
. Unzip the file and open the *web* folder to access the files inside. 
. In your completed CloudFormation stack, go to the Outputs tab and retrieve the *APIURL*.
. Open the file named *scripts.js* and replace the *baseUrl* with the *APIURL* you retrieved from the stack Outputs tab. Save the changes to the file.

==== Example

    ** *Before*: `const baseUrl = 'https://API-ID.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/';` 
    ** *After*: `const baseUrl = 'https://qy7ryx6nkg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/';`

[start=5]
. Open the website S3 bucket created by the stack in your S3 console, and upload the five files in the web folder to the S3 bucket. *NOTE:* upload the files, not the *web* folder itself. The files should exist in the root of the bucket, not within the *web* folder.
. In your completed CloudFormation stack again, go to the Outputs tab and retrieve the *LandingPageURL*. This is the URL that points to a CloudFront distribution to ensure low latency for the registration page.
. Provide the domain name to the AWS Marketplace Seller Operations team.
    ** If you already have an open Request to publish the listing, then submit the *LandingPageURL* in the *SaaS URL* field of the Request form.
    ** If you don't already have an open Request to publish the listing, then submit a request to edit the *SaaS URL* and set it to the *LandingPageURL* by following the steps listed in our Seller Guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/saas-product-settings.html#update-fulfillment-options

* SaaS fulfillment URL format: https://_<domain name>_/index.html
* Example URL: https://d142rocbcrghws.cloudfront.net/index.html

=== Confirm the Amazon SNS subscription

To receive email notifications on the MarketplaceTechAdmin email address for subscription events, confirm the subscription to the newly deployed SNS topic. You will have received an email susbcription confirmation link after the stack was launched. Choose the confirmation link and confirm your subscription. 

=== Test the Entitlements (SaaS Contracts and Contracts with Consumption)

For SaaS contracts and contracts with consumption listings, you need to test that the QuickStart stack is able to correctly call the GetEntitlements API to retrieve subscribers' contract entitlements. To do so, login to AWS under your seller account, and navigate to your AWS Marketplace product listing page.

Once there, select *View purchase options* and then choose any of the contract options available. Finally, select *Create contract*. When you are prompted to confirm the purchase, select *Yes*. This will charge your seller account, but you can always request a refund later if the charge is significant.

When the payment is confirmed, select *Set up your account* to be redirected to the registration page. On the registration page, enter your contact information and choose *Submit*. This information, along with your contract entitlement information, will be stored in the AWSMarketplaceSubscribers DynamoDB table.

To verify that testing has passed, confirm the following:
. The registration page loads fully with no error messages
. The registration page displays a "Success!" message after you click *Submit*
. You receive an email notification on the MarketplaceTechAdmin email address with the entitlement information
. The customer information is stored in the AWSMarketplaceSubscribers DynamoDB table
    ** To check the DynamoDB table, navigate to DynamoDB in the AWS Management Console, select *Tables* from the navigation menu, choose the *AWSMarketplaceSubscribers* table, and select *Explore table items*. The table should have a new item with the new customer entitlement information.

If all of the above are confirmed, then testing has passed, and your integration is fully operational!

=== Test the Metering (SaaS Subscriptions and Contracts with Consumption)

For SaaS subscriptions and contracts with consumption listings, you need to test that the QuickStart stack is able to correctly call the BatchMeterUsage API to send metering records to the AWS Marketplace Metering Service. To do so, login to AWS under your seller account, and navigate to your AWS Marketplace product listing page.

Once there, select *View purchase options* and then either select a contract option and select *Create contract*, or choose *Subscribe*. When you are prompted to confirm the purchase, select *Yes*. For SaaS contracts with consumption products, this will charge your seller account, but you can always request a refund later if the charge is significant.

When the subscription is confirmed, select *Set up your account* to be redirected to the registration page. On the registration page, enter your contact information and choose *Submit*. This information, along with your subscription information, will be stored in the AWSMarketplaceSubscribers DynamoDB table.

Now that you are subscribed, you need to test that you can send metering records. To do so, follow the steps listed here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/how-meter-usage-subscriptions-using-saas-quick-start/

To verify that testing has passed, confirm the following:
. The registration page loads fully with no error messages
. The registration page displays a "Success!" message after you click *Submit*
. You receive an email notification on the MarketplaceTechAdmin email address with the subscription status
. The customer information is stored in the AWSMarketplaceSubscribers DynamoDB table
    ** To check the DynamoDB table, navigate to DynamoDB in the AWS Management Console, select *Tables* from the navigation menu, choose the *AWSMarketplaceSubscribers* table, and select *Explore table items*. The table should have a new item with the new customer entitlement information.
. A metering record was successfully sent from the AWSMarketplaceMeteringRecords DynamoDB table

If all of the above are confirmed, then testing has passed, and your integration is fully operational!

== How it works
// If steps are required to test the deployment, add them here. If not, remove the heading

As shown in <<architecture2>>,the {partner-product-short-name} on AWS environment sets up the following workflow of events.

=== Register new customers

With SaaS subscriptions and contracts, customers subscribe to your products through AWS Marketplace, but they access the product on an environment that you manage in your AWS account. After subscribing to a product, customers are directed to a product registration page that you create and manage as a part of your SaaS product. 

On your software’s registration page, you can collect whatever information is required to create an account for your customer. AWS Marketplace recommends collecting email addresses if you plan to send customers usage notifications.

The registration page identifies and accepts the *x-amzn-marketplace-token* token from the AWS Marketplace form data. The token includes the customer’s identiﬁer for billing. The page then passes the token value to the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and AWS Marketplace Entitlement Service APIs to resolve for the unique customer identiﬁer and corresponding product code.

The Quick Start creates a static HTML registration page hosted on Amazon S3. The page takes user inputs that are defined in the HTML form and submits them to the customer endpoint on AWS Marketplace. The page is delivered via a CloudFront distribution, which can be configured to use domain/CNAME. The POST request coming from AWS Marketplace is intercepted by the Lambda@Edge *src/lambda-edge/edge-redirect.js* function, which transforms the POST request to a GET request and passes the *x-amzn-marketplace-token* in the query string. The handler for the customer endpoint on AWS Marketplace is defined in the *src/register-new-subscriber.js* function, which calls the *resolveCustomer* endpoint and validates the token. If the token is valid, the customer record is created in the *AWSMarketplaceSubscribers* DynamoDB table, and the new customer data is stored.

=== Grant access to new subscribers

After the *resolveCustomer* endpoint returns a successful response, you (the SaaS provider) must provide the new subscriber access to the solution. Based on the type of listing (contract or subscriptions), different conditions are defined in the *grant-revoke-access-to-product.js* stream handler that's initiated when adding new or updating existing rows.

In the Quick Start deployment, the AWS Marketplace Tech Admin email address (which is defined as the *MarketplaceTechAdmin* deployment parameter) receives email notifications when new services must be provisioned or existing services must be updated for a customer. AWS Marketplace strongly recommends automating the access and environment management by modifying the *grant-revoke-access-to-product.js* function. The property *successfully subscribed* is set when a successful response is returned by the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) entitlement handler for SaaS contract-based listings or for subscriptions-based listings after receiving the *subscribe-success* message from the subscription Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic in the *subscription-sqs-handler.js* function.

=== Update entitlement levels to new and existing subscribers (SaaS contracts only)

If a customer’s entitlement changes, a message is received on the Amazon SNS topic for the entitlement. On each new message, the *entitlement-sqs.js* Lambda function calls the AWS Marketplace *EntitlementService* endpoint and stores the response in the *AWSMarketplaceSubscribers* DynamoDB table. When the entitlement is updated, a notification is sent to the AWS Marketplace Tech Admin email address.

=== Revoke access to customers with expired contracts and canceled subscriptions

The revoke-access logic is implemented in a similar way as the grant-access logic. The AWS Marketplace Tech Admin address receives an email when the contract expires or the subscription is canceled. AWS Marketplace strongly recommends automating the access and environment management by modifying the *grant-revoke-access-to-product.js* function.

=== Meter for usage

For SaaS subscriptions listings, the SaaS vendor must meter for all usage and report the metering record to AWS Marketplace, which then bills customers based on the records provided. For SaaS contracts, the vendor only meters for usage beyond a customer’s contract entitlements. The SaaS provider must send AWS a quantity of usage accrued for each customer on the dimensions defined when you created your product, such as gigabytes transferred or hosts scanned in a given hour.

The *MeteringSchedule* CloudWatch event rule is triggered every hour. At that time, the *metering-hourly-job.js* function queries all of the pending and unreported metering records from the *AWSMarketplaceMeteringRecords* table using the *PendingMeteringRecordsIndex* index. All pending records are aggregated based on the *customerIdentifier* property and dimension name and sent to the *SQSMetering* queue. The records in the *AWSMarketplaceMeteringRecords* table should be inserted programmatically by your SaaS application. To allow write access to the *AWSMarketplaceMeteringRecords* table, you must give permissions to the service in charge of collecting usage data in your existing SaaS product.

The *metering-sqs.js* Lambda function sends all queued metering records to the AWS Marketplace Metering Service API. After each call to the *batchMeterUsage* endpoint, the rows in the *AWSMarketplaceMeteringRecords* table are updated with the response returned from the Metering Service. Responses are stored in the *metering_response* field. If the request is unsuccessful, the *metering_failed* value is set to true, and you must investigate the error defined in the *metering_response* field.

New records in the *AWSMarketplaceMeteringRecords* table should be stored in the following format:


....
{
  "create_timestamp": {
    "N": "113123"
  },
  "customerIdentifier": {
    "S": "ifAPi5AcF3"
  },
  "dimension_usage": {
    "L": [
      {
        "M": {
          "dimension": {
            "S": "users"
          },
          "value": {
            "N": "3"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "M": {
          "dimension": {
            "S": "admin_users"
          },
          "value": {
            "N": "1"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "metering_pending": {
    "S": "true"
  }
}
....

The *create_timestamp* attribute is the sort key, and the *customerIdentifier* attribute is the partition key. The sort and partition keys are combined to form the primary key.
 
After the record is submitted to the AWS Marketplace API, the record updates, and the entry looks similar to the following: 

....
{
   "create_timestamp": 113123,
   "customerIdentifier": "ifAPi5AcF3",
   "dimension_usage": [
     {
       "dimension": "admin_users",
       "value": 3
     }
   ],
   "metering_failed": false,
   "metering_response": "{\"Results\":[{\"UsageRecord\":{\"Timestamp\":\"2020-06-24T04:04:53.776Z\",\"CustomerIdentifier\":\"ifAPi5AcF3\",\"Dimension\":\"admin_users\",\"Quantity\":3},\"MeteringRecordId\":\"35155d37-56cb-423f-8554-5c4f3e3ff56d\",\"Status\":\"Success\"}],\"UnprocessedRecords\":[]}"
 }
....
