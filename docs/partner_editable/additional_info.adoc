*Connecting your Cloudfront Distribution to API Gateway*

To connect the Cloudfront Distribution of the registration page, you’ll need to update the baseUrl in web/script.js with the API Gateway endpoint URL.

1. Retrieve the ID of the API you just deployed from https://console.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/main/apis?region=us-east-1[API Gateway^].
2. Update the baseUrl in the /web/scripts.js with the the API ID you just retrieved. This file is located within the s3://<WEBSITE_BUCKET_NAME>/ bucket, where WEBSITE_BUCKET_NAME is a deployment parameter you define. Please reference the before and after example below. Save the change. +
    *Before*: `const baseUrl = 'https://API-ID.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/';` +
    *After*: `const baseUrl = 'https://qy7ryx6nkg.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/';`
3. If using an IDE, you can update S3 with 'aws s3 cp ./web/ s3://<WEBSITE_BUCKET_NAME>/ --recursive'

*Confirm SNS Subscription*

1. To receive email notifications on the MarketplaceTechAdmin email address for subscription events, you’ll need to confirm the subscription to the newly deployed SNS topic.
